# Some other interesting fields in the get attribute replies are file type, number of links, the uid and gid, file id, time of access, and time of last modification

# Question 4
#awk '/read/ { print $6}' NFS
#awk '/write/ { print $6}' NFS
# Looking at column 6 in read/write entries we can see that requests are processed sequentially. We see that the id's that map replies to requests come sequentially. Since in most cases, the reply will come almost immediatly after the request, we know that NFS is processing requests sequentially.There is a case when two requests come within quick succession so you see a different id come after the first request, but then they are proccessed in the order that they came in.
